Try online demo here: [demonstration](http://leftstick.github.io/BaiduMapForAngularJS/)

>If you are using the previous version `1.2.1`, [read it here](https://github.com/leftstick/BaiduMapForAngularJS/tree/1.x)

>If you are looking for `angular2` support, check it here: [angular2-baidu-map](https://github.com/cheng-jie/angular2-baidu-map)

## Getting started

> Note: Baidu-map API currently doesn't support `https`, switch to [a-map](https://github.com/leftstick/angular-amap) API if you plan deploying to an `https` server.

This is a directive for AngularJS `^1.2.0`. And ease the way to display a baidu-map on your page.

If you plan to hack on the directives or want to run the example locally, first thing to do is to install NPM dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

### Launch the demo

To run the demo page, just run

```shell
npm start
```

and open your browser on `http://localhost:8080/`.
